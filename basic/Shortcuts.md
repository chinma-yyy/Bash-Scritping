## Control Key Combinations

- ### **Ctl-A**  
  Moves cursor to the beginning of the line of text (on the command-line).

- ### **Ctl-B**  
  Backspace (nondestructive).

- ### **Ctl-E**  
  Moves cursor to the end of the line of text (on the command-line).

- ### **Ctl-H**  
  Rubout (destructive backspace). Erases characters the cursor backs over while backspacing.

- ### **Ctl-L**  
  Formfeed (clear the terminal screen). In a terminal, this has the same effect as the `clear` command. When sent to a printer, a Ctl-L causes an advance to the end of the paper sheet.

- ### **Ctl-P**  
  Recalls the last command from the history buffer (on the command-line).

- ### **Ctl-U**  
  Erase a line of input, from the cursor backward to the beginning of the line. In some settings, Ctl-U erases the entire line of input, regardless of cursor position.

- ### **Ctl-W**  
  When typing text on the console or in an xterm window, Ctl-W erases from the character under the cursor backward to the first instance of whitespace. In some settings, Ctl-W erases backward to the first non-alphanumeric character.

- ### **Ctl-X**  
  In certain word processing programs, cuts highlighted text and copies to clipboard.

- ### **Ctl-Y**  
  Pastes back text previously erased (with Ctl-U or Ctl-W).
